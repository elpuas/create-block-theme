# Create Block Theme

This my first try to create a CLI using Node, all the magic happen on `bin/create-block-theme.js`
simply run:

```
npx @elpuas/create-block-theme
```

# Why

I think this is the fastest way to have a blank based theme and start hacking, This script will fetch and clone my block based theme starter repo. this theme starter has `wp-scripts`.

Happy Coding!
